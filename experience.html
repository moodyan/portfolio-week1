              <p>Going into college in 2008 as an eighteen-year-old, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I thought my life would be a linear path:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Graduate from high-school.</li>
                <li>College for four years - no more, no less.</li>
                <li>Get a good job that would support my passions outside of work.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>However, after college, life threw me a few curve-balls and I realized just how non-linear life can be and how much more there is than an ordered list to check off.</p>
              <p>Over the last five years, I have felt restless and unchallenged in my daily tasks at the various companies with whom I have resided. While I have always been a hard worker regarldless of the ease of task at hand, I felt my skills and abilities were not being utilized to their fullest potential.
              <p>I began to contemplate my aptitudes and what I've enjoyed doing in the past and what potential careers would potentially align with that. I love problem-solving and I am very analytical. My dad was a software developer for over 20 years and was that little bird whispering in my ear, telling me that development was the way to go. I finally decided to dive in, head first. And boy, am I glad I did.</p>
